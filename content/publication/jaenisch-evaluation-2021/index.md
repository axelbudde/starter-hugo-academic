abstract: "textlessptextgreater textbfIntroduction Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the German Health Ministry has issued restrictions applying to the field of orthopaedics and trauma surgery. Besides postponement of elective surgeries, outpatient consultations have been drastically reduced. Parallel to these developments, an increase in telemedical consultations has reflected efforts to provide sufficient patient care. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical examination of the hip joint and pelvis by way of a telemedical consultation.textless/ptextgreater textlessptextgreater textbfMaterials and Methods Twenty-nine patients of a German university clinic were recruited and assessed in both telemedical and conventional examinations. Agreement between the two examinations was then assessed, and connections between the observed agreement and patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification were investigated.textless/ptextgreater textlessptextgreater textbfResults The inspections agreed closely with a mean Cohenʼs kappa of 0.76 ± 0.37. Palpation showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohenʼs kappa of 0.38 ± 0.19. Function showed good agreement with a mean Cohenʼs kappa of 0.61 ± 0.26 and range of motion showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohenʼs kappa of 0.36 ± 0.19. A significant positive correlation was observed between the number of deviations in the different examinations and age (p = 0.05), and a significant positive correlation was shown between the number of non-feasible examinations and age (p textless 0.01), BMI (p textless 0.01) and ASA classification score (p textless 0.01).textless/ptextgreater textlessptextgreater textbfDiscussion Inspection and function can be reliably evaluated, whereas the significance of palpation, provocation and measurement of range of motion is limited. The small sample size puts limitations on the significance of a statistically relevant correlation between patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification score and valid and successful implementation of a telemedical examination. The authors recommend targeted patient selection. If, however, patients are being evaluated who are very old (textgreater 75 years), obese (BMI textgreater 30) or with multiple comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), caution is advised. Large, prospective studies are needed in the future to fully validate telemedical consultations in the fields of orthopaedics and trauma surgery.textless/ptextgreater textlessptextgreater textbfConclusion A telemedical examination of the hip joint and pelvis can be performed with certain limitations. Patient-specific factors such as age, BMI, and extent of comorbidities appear to have a relevant impact on validity and execution of the examination. Patients with multiple comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), advanced age (textgreater 75 years) or obesity (BMI textgreater 30) should, whenever possible, be examined in a conventional outpatient setting.textless/ptextgreater"
