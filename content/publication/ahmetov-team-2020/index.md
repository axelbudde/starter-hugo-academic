abstract: "• Predictive genetic testing of an asymptomatic person has considerable potential to predict future risk of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity.   • Risk alleles for COVID-19 severity due to the pleiotropic effects are associated with performance-related traits.   • Team sport, power, and combat athletes possess a higher genetic risk for COVID-19 severity than untrained subjects or endurance athletes.   • Polygenic risk scores based on 6 gene polymorphisms show a significant geographical variation, putting some countries at greater risk than others."
