 abstract = {TO THE EDITOR:Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is the most common and severe manifestation of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), which is a rare side effect of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca/Oxford).1-4 The absolute risk of VITT and VITT-related CVT is estimated at 20 and 8 per million first doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, respectively.5,6So far, no definite VITT cases occurring after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine dose have been reported, raising the question of whether VITT only occurs after a first dose. Two pharmacovigilance studies reported cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose, but because of lack of clinical data, none of these could be classified as VITT.7-9 Knowledge on whether VITT can occur after a second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose is relevant for clinicians and policymakers, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which are currently the main users of adenovirus-based vaccines.10},
