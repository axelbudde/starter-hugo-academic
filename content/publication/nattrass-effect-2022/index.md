abstract: "Age is associated with changes in the immune system which increase the risk for severe COVID-19. Here, we investigate SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells from individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild COVID-19 symptoms after 3, 6 and 9 months using incubation with SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2 and N-peptide pools, followed by flow cytometry for a Th1-activation profile or proliferation analyses. We found that SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells are decreasing on average after 9 months but highly polyfunctional CD4 T cells can peak after 6-month recovery. We show that individuals older than 60 years of age have significantly more SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in their blood after 3 months of recovery compared to younger individuals and that the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-reactive Th1-directed CD4 T cells in the blood of mild-COVID-19-recovered individuals correlates with age. Finally, we show that individuals over the age of 40 have significantly increased the amounts of highly polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-S-peptide-reactive CD4 T cells, compared to SARS-CoV-2 na√Øve individuals, than those under the age of 40. These findings suggest that in individuals recovered from mild COVID-19, increased age is associated with significantly more highly polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells with a Th1-profile and that these responses persist over time."
