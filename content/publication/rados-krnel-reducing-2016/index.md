abstract: 'Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm is an initiative under the
  EU health programme to take forward the work in line with the first EU Strategy
  on alcohol related harm. The work is carried out through a cooperation by expert
  organisations from 32 European countries. RARHA’s Work Package 6 aims to present
  a Tool Kit of interventions that have demonstrated their effectiveness, transferability
  and relevance.In the communication with MS representatives and WP 6 partners we
  decided to collect the examples of good practices appertain to one of the three
  groups of interventions: Early interventions, Public awareness and School-based
  interventions. Using RARHA’s network and CNAPA we have searched for professionals
  experienced in alcohol related interventions, with a good overview and knowledge
  on interventions in their country, to provide reliable data at country level. In
  order to assess the collected examples we have developed the Assessment criteria
  based on an existing Dutch system for evaluating health-based interventions. The
  interventions were assessed based on the following criteria: a. Intervention is
  well described, b. Intervention is implemented in the real world/feasible/transferable,
  c. Intervention has a theoretical base and d. Intervention has been evaluated. There
  are four levels of evidence-based depending on the design of the studies that were
  looking into the effects of the intervention.'
