 abstract = {The occurrence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in critically ill patients with viral pneumonitis has increasingly been reported in recent years. Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) are the two most common forms of this fungal infection. These diseases cause high mortality in patients, most of whom were previously immunocompetent. The pathogenesis of IAPA and CAPA is still not fully understood, but involves viral, fungal and host factors. In this article, we discuss several aspects regarding IAPA and CAPA, including their possible pathogenesis, the use of immunotherapy, and future challenges.},
