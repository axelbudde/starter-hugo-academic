abstract: "• TeleNP represents a medium through which clinical research and important clinical care can continue.   • We discuss benefits, challenges, and practical considerations in the use of teleNP.   • We describe how the Australian Epilepsy Project has adapted to the COVID-19 environment.   • TeleNP data acquired to date reveals deficits typical of those observed in epilepsy.   • TeleNP presents an opportunity to expand the reach and breadth of neuropsychological services."
