abstract: "Background: Due to the corona pandemic, we conducted the Heidelberg module of the Master of Medical Education (MME) study program, which focuses on teaching and assessment of communicative and interpofessional skills, digitally for the first time., Method: We outsourced the teaching to a pre-module phase in the weeks upfront. During the module week, the lecturers picked up again and deepened the topics and the participants created, revised and simulated a virtual OSCE course. , Results/Conclusion: Evaluation and reflection of the module showed that the digital implementation including an OSCE examination can be an appropriate alternative to a classroom-based training. However, important elements of the MME program that provide networking possibilities and personal exchange can only be replicated in the digital environment to a limited extent. In the future, sensibly applied digital components can be used to enrich the study program."
