 abstract = {Background: The current study aimed to assess the anxiety and fear levels and the attitude towards clinical care, such as the use of personal protective equipment and number of patients examined, before and after COVID-19 vaccination among Turkish dental professionals. Methods: A questionnaire including socio-demographical characteristics and clinical data regarding the number of patients, the use of personal protective equipment, vaccine confidence interval, positive or negative COVID-19 diagnosis, and fear and anxiety levels were examined. Results: A total of 475 dentists (196 men and 279 women) participated. Overall, the vaccination had a positive effect on the decrease of fear and anxiety levels of dental professionals. It was observed that the number of interventional procedures significantly increased after vaccination. Besides that, the amount of personal protective equipment used in patients, especially after the vaccination, has decreased. Conclusion: Despite the positive effects of vaccination on the anxiety levels of dental professionals, protective measurements should further be the main concern, regardless of the vaccination status of both the dental professional and the patient.},
