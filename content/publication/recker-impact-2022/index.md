abstract: "The pandemic SARS-CoV-2 poses new and unprecedented challenges for health care systems on a national and global level. Although the current situation has been going on for more than 1 year, there is limited data on the impact of the pandemic on general hospital and medical practice care. This survey captures the perspective of patients with gynaecological diseases of this impact."
