abstract: "The infection fatality rate (IFR) of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most discussed figures in the context of this pandemic. In contrast to the case fatality rate (CFR), the IFR depends on the total number of infected individuals â€“ not just on the number of confirmed cases. In order to estimate the IFR, several seroprevalence studies have been or are currently conducted."
