<title>Trends in educational disparities in preventive behaviours, risk perception, perceived effectiveness and trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany | BMC Public Health | Full Text</title>
<meta name=citation_abstract content="Educational disparities in health and health behaviours have always been relevant in public health research and are particularly challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. First studies suggest that factors important for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as prevention behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness of containment measures, and trust in authorities handling the pandemic, vary by educational status. This study builds on recent debate by examining trends in absolute and relative educational disparities in these factors in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Data stem from four waves of the GESIS Panel surveyed between March and October 2020 in Germany (15,902 observations from 4,690 individuals). Trends in absolute and relative disparities were examined for preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures, and trust in individuals and institutions handling the COVID-19 pandemic by educational status using sex, age, residence, nationality, children under 16 living in household, family status, household size, the Big Five Inventory, and income class as control factors. Descriptive statistics as well as unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models and random effects models were performed. We observed an initially rising and then falling trend in preventive behaviour with consistent and significant absolute and relative disparities with a lower preventive behaviour among low educated individuals. Indication of a U-shaped trend with consistent significantly lower values among lower educated individuals was found for risk perception, whereas perceived effectiveness and trust decreased significantly over time but did not significantly vary by educational status. Results indicate persistent educational disparities in preventive behaviour and risk perception and a general decline in perceived effectiveness and trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. To address this overall downward trend and existing disparities, comprehensive and strategic management is needed to communicate the risks of the pandemic and the benefits of COVID-19 containment measures. Both must be adapted to the different needs of educational groups in particular in order to overcome gaps in preventive behaviour and risk perception by educational status.">

<meta property=og:title content="Trends in educational disparities in preventive behaviours, risk perception, perceived effectiveness and trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany - BMC Public Health">
<meta property=og:description content="Background Educational disparities in health and health behaviours have always been relevant in public health research and are particularly challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. First studies suggest that factors important for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as prevention behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness of containment measures, and trust in authorities handling the pandemic, vary by educational status. This study builds on recent debate by examining trends in absolute and relative educational disparities in these factors in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Methods Data stem from four waves of the GESIS Panel surveyed between March and October 2020 in Germany (15,902 observations from 4,690 individuals). Trends in absolute and relative disparities were examined for preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures, and trust in individuals and institutions handling the COVID-19 pandemic by educational status using sex, age, residence, nationality, children under 16 living in household, family status, household size, the Big Five Inventory, and income class as control factors. Descriptive statistics as well as unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models and random effects models were performed. Results We observed an initially rising and then falling trend in preventive behaviour with consistent and significant absolute and relative disparities with a lower preventive behaviour among low educated individuals. Indication of a U-shaped trend with consistent significantly lower values among lower educated individuals was found for risk perception, whereas perceived effectiveness and trust decreased significantly over time but did not significantly vary by educational status. Conclusions Results indicate persistent educational disparities in preventive behaviour and risk perception and a general decline in perceived effectiveness and trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. To address this overall downward trend and existing disparities, comprehensive and strategic management is needed to communicate the risks of the pandemic and the benefits of COVID-19 containment measures. Both must be adapted to the different needs of educational groups in particular in order to overcome gaps in preventive behaviour and risk perception by educational status.">

First studies suggest that factors important for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as prevention behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness of containment measures, and trust in authorities handling the pandemic, vary by educational status. This study builds on recent debate by examining trends in absolute and relative educational disparities in these factors in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.<h3 class=c-article__sub-heading data-test=abstract-sub-heading>Methods</h3><p>Data stem from four waves of the GESIS Panel surveyed between March and October 2020 in Germany (15,902 observations from 4,690 individuals). Trends in absolute and relative disparities were examined for preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures, and trust in individuals and institutions handling the COVID-19 pandemic by educational status using sex, age, residence, nationality, children under 16 living in household, family status, household size, the Big Five Inventory, and income class as control factors. Descriptive statistics as well as unadjusted and adjusted linear regression models and random effects models were performed.<h3 class=c-article__sub-heading data-test=abstract-sub-heading>Results</h3><p>We observed an initially rising and then falling trend in preventive behaviour with consistent and significant absolute and relative disparities with a lower preventive behaviour among low educated individuals. Indication of a U-shaped trend with consistent significantly lower values among lower educated individuals was found for risk perception, whereas perceived effectiveness and trust decreased significantly over time but did not significantly vary by educational status.<h3 class=c-article__sub-heading data-test=abstract-sub-heading>Conclusions</h3><p>Results indicate persistent educational disparities in preventive behaviour and risk perception and a general decline in perceived effectiveness and trust in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. To address this overall downward trend and existing disparities, comprehensive and strategic management is needed to communicate the risks of the pandemic and the benefits of COVID-19 containment measures. Both must be adapted to the different needs of educational groups in particular in order to overcome gaps in preventive behaviour and risk perception by educational status.</p></div></div></section>

In 2016 and 2018, the GESIS Panel sample was supplemented by refresher samples taken from samples of the General Population Survey of the Social Sciences (ALLBUS). In 2020, the GESIS Panel comprised approximately 5,000 panellists (a detailed overview of the number of panel participants in the waves included in this study is available in Supplementary Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>1</a>).<p>The GESIS&nbsp;Panel questionnaires are structured in modules. These modules have different thematic orientations in each of the six annual surveys. The COVID-19 module was introduced initially in the special survey on the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Germany in March 2020 (baseline survey) and were subsequently implemented in three further waves of the survey in May to June 2020 (survey wave 2), July to August 2020 (survey wave 3), and August to October 2020 (survey wave 4). In order to be able to collect data on the pandemic in timely manner, only the subsample of online participants was considered in the special (baseline) survey. In the further survey waves, both online and offline participants were considered. The analytical sample consists of all individuals for which information on the variables considered was available (15,902 observations from 4,690 individuals) (a detailed overview of the total non-response rate and the item unit-nonresponse is available in Supplementary Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>2</a>). The median participation rate was 3.39 observations per person, with 4.6% participating in one (<i>n</i> = 217), 8.3% in two (<i>n</i> = 389), 30.5% in three (<i>n</i> = 1,429), and 56.6% in all survey waves (<i>n</i> = 2,655).

To answer this question, the respondents were given a multiple choice of nine different measures (response category: no vs. yes.) (the exact wording of all items is available in Supplementary Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>3</a>). All items were combined into an additive scale that ranges from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate higher preventive behaviour. Internal consistency measured by the Kuder-Ricardson 20 formula proved to be adequate in each survey wave (KR 20 &gt; 0.5).<p>Risk perception was measured by a sum score of five items. These capture the respondents' assessment of the likelihood that they or someone in their immediate environment would become infected with SARS-CoV-2, would need hospitalization due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection, would need to be in quarantine, or would infect other persons in the next 24&nbsp;months (ranging from 1: “not at all likely” to 7: “absolutely likely”) (the exact wording of all items is available in Supplementary Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>4</a>). All items were combined into an additive scale that ranges from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate higher perceptions of risks. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach’s alpha proved to be high in each survey wave (α &gt; 0.8).<p>Perceived effectiveness of containment measures against SARS-CoV-2 infections was measured by a sum score of seven items. Respondents were asked to rate the effectiveness of measures such as the closure of various facilities and businesses, the ban on visiting hospitals and long-term care facilities, and exit restrictions in containing the COVID-19 pandemic (ranging from: 1 “not effective at all” to 5: “very effective”) (the exact wording of all items is available in Supplementary Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>5</a>). All items were combined into an additive scale that ranges from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate higher perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach’s alpha proved to be high in each survey wave (α &gt; 0.8).<p>Trust in people and institutions to handle the COVID-19 pandemic was measured by a sum score of nine items. Respondents were asked to evaluate how much they trust general practitioners, local health authority, municipal and city administration, the Robert Koch Institute (German federal government agency and research institute for disease control and prevention), the federal chancellor, the federal government, the federal ministry of health, the World Health Organization, and scientists handling coronavirus (ranging from 1 “do not trust at all” to 5 “trust completely”) (the exact wording of all items is available in Supplementary Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>6</a>).

The SII represents an absolute difference in outcomes between the lowest and highest educational groups. The RII represents relative disparities in terms of the percentage difference from the population mean in the outcomes between the highest and lowest educational groups. To calculate the SII and RII, educational status was transformed into ridit scores, ranging from 0 (lowest educational status) to 1 (highest educational status). Two-sided 95% CIs for the RII and SII were estimated based on random effects panel modelling. Stepwise regression was used to examine factors affecting relative and absolute disparities in preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust by educational status. First, educational status, a linear and quadratic trend variable, and an interaction term between educational status and the trend variables was fitted to the data in regression model 1 (M1). Model 2 (M2) was based on M1, and also included the Big Five Inventory to test whether personal traits influence the association between educational status and the outcome measures. Model 3 (M3) was based on M2 and also included sex, age, residence, nationality, children under 16 living in household, family status, and household size, which are assumed to interact with educational status and the outcome measures. Finally, model 4 (M4) was based on M3 and also included income class, which strongly relates to educational status and might also influence educational disparities in preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust. The degree of model fit was assessed with McFadden’s pseudo R<sup>2</sup>. McFadden’s R<sup>2</sup> ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better model fit. Values between 0.2 and 0.4 are considered to be indicative of excellent model fit. Analyses were performed with Stata 16.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).<div class=c-article-table data-test=inline-table data-container-section=table id=table-3><figure><figcaption class=c-article-table__figcaption><b id=Tab3 data-test=table-caption>Table 3 Random effects model for absolute educational disparities (SII) in preventive behaviours, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust (Number of observations: 15,902; number of individuals: 4,690)</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class=c-article__pill-button data-test=table-link data-track=click data-track-action="view table" data-track-label=button rel=nofollow href=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13341-3/tables/3 aria-label="Full size table 3"><span>Full size table</span><svg width=16 height=16 focusable=false role=img aria-hidden=true class=u-icon><use xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink xlink:href=#global-icon-chevron-right></use></svg></a></div></figure></div><div class=c-article-table data-test=inline-table data-container-section=table id=table-4><figure><figcaption class=c-article-table__figcaption><b id=Tab4 data-test=table-caption>Table 4 Random effects model for relative educational disparities (RII) in preventive behaviours, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust (Number of observations: 15,902; number of individuals: 4,690)</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class=c-article__pill-button data-test=table-link data-track=click data-track-action="view table" data-track-label=button rel=nofollow href=https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13341-3/tables/4 aria-label="Full size table 4"><span>Full size table</span><svg width=16 height=16 focusable=false role=img aria-hidden=true class=u-icon><use xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink xlink:href=#global-icon-chevron-right></use></svg></a></div></figure></div></div></div></section><section data-title=Results><div class=c-article-section id=Sec8-section><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id=Sec8>Results</h2><div class=c-article-section__content id=Sec8-content><p>Raw mean levels and trends in preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust by educational status were shown in Table <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="table anchor" href=#Tab2>2</a>. For preventive behaviour, we observed a significant inverted U-shape trend for all educational groups with initially rising and then falling mean values from survey wave three onward. In each wave of the survey, individuals with low educational status are significantly less likely to engage in preventive behaviours than individuals with high educational status (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). A significant non-linear trend with an indication of a U-shape trend can be identified in risk perception for all education groups. Raw mean values in risk perception fell sharply after the baseline survey and slightly increased at survey wave four. Over the entire observation period, persons with a low educational status had a significantly lower risk perception than persons with a high educational status (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). For raw mean values in perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures, we observed a significant steady decline over the course of the study across all educational groups. This trend was strongest for groups with intermediate educational status and resulted in significantly lower perceived effectiveness compared to low educational status groups in survey wave three (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and four (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Raw mean values in trust in persons and institutions handling the COVID-19 pandemic also significantly declined across all educational groups. Over the course of the study, raw mean values in trust did not significantly vary by educational status.<p>Figure&nbsp;<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="figure anchor" href=#Fig2>2</a> shows the marginal mean levels in preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust by educational status adjusted for sex, age, residence, nationality, children under 16 living in household, family status, household size, the Big Five Inventory, and income class (the full results are available in Supplementary Tables <a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>7</a>,<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>8</a>,<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>9</a>,<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=#MOESM1>10</a>).

The different trend courses in preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust proved to be significant (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in all educational groups. Significant differences (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in preventive behaviour emerge in all survey waves to the disadvantage of low educational status groups. These educational differences were significant for risk perception from wave two onward and for trust only in wave four.

Trends in SII were not significant indicating that absolute disparities in preventive behaviour did not vary over time (p &gt; 0.05), whereas we noted a small and significant downward trend in RIIs in preventive behaviour (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). For risk perception, we observed significant disparities by educational status in absolute and relative term that were not influenced by the control variables. Moreover, the non-significant trends for the SII and RII indicated that the absolute und relative disparities in risk perception did not vary over time.

We observed an initially rising and then falling trend in preventive behaviour with consistent absolute and relative disparities with a lower preventive behaviour among low educated individuals. Indication of a U-shaped trend with consistent significantly lower values among lower educated individuals was found for risk perception, whereas perceived effectiveness and trust decreased significantly over time but did not vary by educational status.<p>The general trends in preventive behaviour, risk perception, perceived effectiveness, and trust coincide with the general pandemic pattern and the measures introduced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic as shown in Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="figure anchor" href=#Fig1>1</a>. The initially increasing and subsequently decreasing general preventive behaviour can be explained on the one hand by the introduction of more restrictive containment measures, such as the obligation to wear a protective mask, and on the other hand by the low SARS-CoV-2 incidence between May and August 2020. This mild course of the pandemic, which gained pace again from September 2020 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="figure anchor" href=#Fig1>1</a>), is possibly responsible for the indicated U-sharp trend in risk perception and illustrates the sensitivity of the respondents to infection patterns during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Respondents appear to react far more sensitive to the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 containment measures and trust in individuals and institutions handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the perceived effectiveness and trust decreased significantly in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, and this despite again increasing infection rates in the last wave of observation in August/October 2020 (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track=click data-track-label=link data-track-action="figure anchor" href=#Fig1>1</a>).<p>The relatively high level of perceived effectiveness and trust at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 might be explained by an anxiety effect and a cognitive need for security [<a data-track=click data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label=link data-test=citation-ref aria-label="Reference 30" title="Schraff D.

Because these measures involve significant restrictions on individual lives, results could vary when the effectiveness of less restrictive measures, such as wearing a protective mask, is surveyed. The comparison between the first and subsequent surveys may be slightly biased because only online panellists were invited to participate in the first survey. Finally, the representativeness of the results for Germany is slightly limited because no design weight was available for the first survey wave.
