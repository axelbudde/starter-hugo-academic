abstract: "• A laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2 was established.   • It consists of minipool testing of nucleic acid preparations.   • Limit of detection was 48 copies per reaction (95 % confidence interval: 33–184).   • A protocol was distributed among five German university hospitals.   • The approach proved its principle and one COVID-19 case was detected in 70 minipools."
