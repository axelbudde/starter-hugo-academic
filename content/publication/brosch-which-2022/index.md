abstract: "The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in repeated, prolonged restrictions in daily life. Social distancing policies as well as health anxiety are thought to lead to mental health impairment. However, there is lack of longitudinal data identifying at-risk populations particularly vulnerable for elevated Covid-19-related distress. We collected data of N = 1268 participants (n = 622 healthy controls (HC), and n = 646 patients with major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) at baseline before (2014–2018) and during (April-May 2020) the first lockdown in Germany. We obtained information on Covid-19 restrictions (number and subjective impact of Covid-19 events), and Covid-19-related distress (i.e., subjective fear and isolation). Using multiple linear regression models including trait variables and individual Covid-19 impact, we sought to predict Covid-19-related distress. HC and patients reported similar numbers of Covid-19-related events, and similar subjective impact rating. They did not differ in Covid-19-related subjective fear. Patients reported significantly higher subjective isolation. 30.5% of patients reported worsened self-rated symptoms since the pandemic. Subjective fear in all participants was associated with trait anxiety (STAI-T), conscientiousness (NEO-FFI), Covid-19 impact, and sex. Subjective isolation in HC was associated with social support (FSozu), Covid-19 impact, age, and sex; in patients, it was associated with social support and Covid-19 impact. Our data shed light on differential effects of the pandemic in psychiatric patients and HC. Low social support, high conscientiousness and high trait anxiety are associated with elevated distress during the pandemic. These variables might be valuable for the creation of risk profiles of Covid-19-related distress for direct translation into clinical practice."
