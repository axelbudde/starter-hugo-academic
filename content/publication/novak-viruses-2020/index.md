abstract: "Viral infections and atopic diseases are closely related and contribute to each other. The physiological deficiencies and immune mechanisms that underlie atopic diseases can result in a suboptimal defense against multiple viruses and promote a suitable environment for their proliferation and dissemination. Viral infections, on the other hand, can induce per se several immunological mechanisms involved in allergic inflammation capable to promote the initiation or exacerbation of atopic diseases such as atopic asthma. In a world that is affected more and more by factors that significantly impact the prevalence of atopic diseases, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) induced by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS‐CoV‐2) is having an unprecedented impact with still unpredictable consequences. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to revise the available scientific literature regarding the association between common respiratory viruses and asthma, as well as the newly emerging data about the molecular mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and its possible relation with asthma, to better understand the interrelation between common viruses and asthma and its potential meaning on the current global pandemic of COVID‐19."
