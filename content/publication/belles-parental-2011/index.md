abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the influence of parental problem
  drinking on implicit and explicit alcohol expectancy of adolescents and young adults
  (12â€“24years). The study was conducted via the Internet, employing a between-subjects
  design. We measured alcohol expectancy by means of an Implicit Association Test
  (IAT) and a self-report questionnaire. A short version of the Children of Alcoholics
  Screening Test (CAST) was used to measure alcohol-related parental problem behavior.
  Our results showed that increased CAST-scores were correlated with a stronger implicit
  association between the concepts alcohol and arousal. In contrast, no such relationship
  was observed between parental problem drinking and self-reported expectancy of alcohol
  arousal. These findings provide tentative evidence that an implicit cognitive processing
  bias is implicated in the intergenerational transmission of addictive behaviors.
