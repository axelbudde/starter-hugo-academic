abstract: "PURPOSE: The pandemic SARS-CoV-2 poses new and unprecedented challenges for health care systems on a national and global level. Although the current situation has been going on for more than 1 year, there is limited data on the impact of the pandemic on general hospital and medical practice care. This survey captures the perspective of patients with gynaecological diseases of this impact. METHODS: Using a paper-based questionnaire, 327 patients were asked about medical care and their experiences during the pandemic at the University Hospital Bonn and the University Hospital Charité Berlin. The study was performed from the 1st June to 30th September 2020. RESULTS: A total of 327 patients participated in the study: 156 stated to have been tested for coronavirus, and 1 patient reported a positive test. 41.3% of the patients felt insecure about the current situation, 30.4% were concerned about the risk of infection during the hospital stay. The pandemic-specific measures in hospitals and medical practices unsettled 6.8% of patients. 18.1% of patients feared that their gynaecological disease would not be treated adequately due to the pandemic. 55.7% of patients reported that their confidence in their physicians has increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The results show that patients' confidence in the healthcare system and the physicians acting significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis. Transparent and comprehensive information policy regarding actions and restrictions within the COVID-19 crisis eases patients concerns and improves patients' confidence in their physicians, which is crucial for a successful treatment's outcome."
