 abstract = {Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical field has been forced to apply the basic knowledge of immunology with the most up-to-date SARS-CoV-2 findings and translate it to the population of the whole world in record time. Following the infection with the viral antigen, adaptive immune responses are activated mainly by viral particle encounters with the antigen-presenting cells or B cell receptors, which induce further biological interactions to defend the host against the virus. After the infection has been warded off, the immunological memory is developed. The SARS-CoV cellular immunity has been shown to persist even 17 years after the infection, despite the undetectable humoral component. Similar has been demonstrated for the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory in a shorter period by assessing interferon-gamma levels when heparinized blood is stimulated with the virus-specific peptides. T cells also play an irreplaceable part in a humoral immune reaction as the backbone of a cellular immune response. They both provide the signals for B cell activation and the maturation, competence, and memory of the humoral response. B cell production of IgA was shown to be of significant influence in mediating mucosal immunity as the first part of the defense mechanism and in the development of nasal vaccines. Here, we interpret the recent SARS-CoV-2 available research, which encompasses the significance and the current understanding of adaptive immune activity, and compare it among naive, exposed, and vaccinated blood donors. Our recent data showed that those who recovered from COVID-19 and those who are vaccinated with EMA-approved vaccines had a long-lasting cellular immunity. Additionally, we analyze the humoral responses in immunocompromised patients and memory mediated by cellular immunity and the impact of clonality in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic regarding breakthrough infections and variants of concern, both B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants.},
