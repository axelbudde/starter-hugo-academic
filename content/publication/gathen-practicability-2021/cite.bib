 abstract = {\textlessp\textgreater \textbfObjective In the course of the corona pandemic, resource conservation and the protection of further infections have made it necessary to break new ground in the organisation of orthopaedic and trauma surgery consultations. One solution is consistent digitisation and the offer of video consultation hours. In this study, non-contact examination of patients with shoulder disorders is described and critically examined.\textless/p\textgreater \textlessp\textgreater \textbfMethods Thirty patients who presented with pathologies of the shoulder joint in a university outpatient clinic were subjected to a physical examination in a conventional and contactless manner. The data obtained on mobility, function and provocation test of both examinations were compared to draw conclusions about the virtual feasibility.\textless/p\textgreater \textlessp\textgreater \textbfResults 46% of the patients suffered from a traumatic shoulder lesion, and 54% showed degenerative lesions. The assessment of mobility showed a high correlation of 70 – 90% between the two examinations. Common tests to evaluate the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and the long head of the biceps could be adequately performed in a contactless version by more than three quarters of the patients, but with low-to-moderate performance values.\textless/p\textgreater \textlessp\textgreater \textbfConclusion Contact-less examination is particularly disadvantageous when evaluating stability criteria. For the medical history and functional test, there were no significant differences between the classic consultation and contactless consultation. Although virtual consultation is a widespread and valuable addition in pandemic times, it cannot replace a safe assessment and indication by personal examination.\textless/p\textgreater},
