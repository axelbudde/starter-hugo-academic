Myocardial injury and inflammation at cardiac MRI in patients with COVID-19 have been described in recent publications. Concurrently, a chronic COVID-19 syndrome (CCS) after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been observed and manifests with symptoms such as fatigue and exertional dyspnea.

Purpose

To explore the relationship between CCS and myocardial injury and inflammation as an underlying cause of the persistent complaints in previously healthy individuals.

Materials and Methods

In this prospective study from January 2021 to April 2021, study participants without known cardiac or pulmonary diseases prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection who had persistent CCS symptoms such as fatigue or exertional dyspnea after convalescence and healthy control participants underwent cardiac MRI. The cardiac MRI protocol included evaluating the T1 and T2 relaxation times, extracellular volume, T2 signal intensity ratio, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Student t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and χ2 tests were used for statistical analysis.

Results

Forty-one participants with CCS (mean age, 39 years ± 13 [standard deviation]; 18 men) and 42 control participants (mean age, 39 years ± 16; 26 men) were evaluated. The median time between the initial incidence of mild to moderate COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization and undergoing cardiac MRI was 103 days (interquartile range, 88–158 days). Troponin T levels were normal. Parameters indicating myocardial inflammation and edema were comparable between participants with CCS and control participants (T1 relaxation times: 978 msec ± 23 vs 971 msec ± 25 [P = .17]; T2 relaxation times: 53 msec ± 2 vs 52 msec ± 2 [P = .47]; T2 signal intensity ratios: 1.6 ± 0.2 vs 1.6 ± 0.3 [P = .10]). Visible myocardial edema was present in none of the participants. Three of 41 (7%) participants with CCS demonstrated nonischemic LGE, whereas no participants in the control group demonstrated nonischemic LGE (0 of 42 [0%]; P = .07). None of the participants fulfilled the 2018 Lake Louise criteria for the diagnosis of myocarditis.

Conclusion

Individuals with chronic COVID-19 syndrome who did not undergo hospitalization for COVID-19 did not demonstrate signs of active myocardial injury or inflammation at cardiac MRI.
