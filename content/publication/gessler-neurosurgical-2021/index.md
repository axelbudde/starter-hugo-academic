abstract: "Given the ongoing global SARS-CoV-2-vaccination efforts, clinical awareness needs to be raised regarding the possibility of an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-related immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to cerebral sinus and vein thrombosis (CVT) requiring (emergency) neurosurgical treatment in the context of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Only recently, an association of vaccinations and cerebral sinus and vein thrombosis has been described. In a number of cases, neurosurgical treatment is warranted for these patients and special considerations are warranted when addressing the perioperative coagulation. We, herein, describe the past management of patients with VITT and established a literature-guided algorithm for the treatment of patients when addressing the impaired coagulation in these patients. Increasing insights addressing the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-vaccine-related immune-mediated thrombocytopenia guide physicians in developing an interdisciplinary algorithm taking into account the special considerations of this disease."
