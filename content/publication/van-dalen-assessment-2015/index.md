abstract: To reduce alcohol related harm a wide range of interventions have been developed
  and brought together including in EU-funded projects. Nevertheless public health
  policy planners lack easy access to well described interventions that are replicable
  and about which reasonable evidence of effectiveness in influencing drinking attitudes
  or behaviours are available. Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm is an
  initiative under the EU health programme to take forward the work in line with the
  first EU Strategy on alcohol related harm. The work is carried out through a cooperation
  by expert organisations from 31 European countries. RARHA’s Work Package 6 aims
  to present a Tool Kit of interventions that have demonstrated their effectiveness,
  transferability and relevance.
