 abstract = {The aim was to evaluate hospitalization rates for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) within an interdisciplinary multicenter neurovascular network (NVN) during the shutdown for the COVID-19 pandemic along with its modifiable risk factors. In this multicenter study, admission rates for SAH were compared for the period of the shutdown for the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany (calendar weeks (cw) 12 to 16, 2020), the periods before (cw 6–11) and after the shutdown (cw 17–21 and 22–26, 2020), as well as with the corresponding cw in the years 2015–2019. Data on all-cause and pre-hospital mortality within the area of the NVN were retrieved from the Department of Health, and the responsible emergency medical services. Data on known triggers for systemic inflammation, e.g., respiratory viruses and air pollution, were analyzed. Hospitalizations for SAH decreased during the shutdown period to one-tenth within the multicenter NVN. There was a substantial decrease in acute respiratory illness rates, and of air pollution during the shutdown period. The implementation of public health measures, e.g., contact restrictions and increased personal hygiene during the shutdown, might positively influence modifiable risk factors, e.g., systemic inflammation, leading to a decrease in the incidence of SAH.},
