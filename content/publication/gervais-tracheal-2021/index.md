abstract: "The vascular system, plastic and positioned in the vicinity of tissues, is an undervalued regulator of adult stem cells. Two studies now show that the vascular-like Drosophila trachea is reshaped after intestinal damage or tumour formation and that this remodelling is required for compensatory intestinal stem cell proliferation and tumour growth."
