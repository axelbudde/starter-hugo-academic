abstract: "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a broad range of clinical and laboratory findings, is currently the most prevalent medical challenge worldwide. In this disease, hypercoagulability and hyperinflammation, two common features, are accompanied by a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. We assessed the association between baseline inflammatory cytokine levels and coagulopathy and disease outcome in COVID-19. One hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were selected for the study. Baseline interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) level were measured at time of admission. At the same time, baseline coagulation parameters were also assessed during the patient’s hospitalization. Clinical findings, including development of thrombosis and clinical outcome, were recorded prospectively. Out of 136 patients, 87 (~64%) had increased cytokine levels (one or more cytokines) or abnormal coagulation parameters. Among them, 58 (~67%) had only increased inflammatory cytokines, 12 (~14%) had only coagulation abnormalities, and 17 (19.5%) had concomitant abnormalities in both systems. It seems that a high level of inflammatory cytokines at admission points to an increased risk of developing coagulopathy, thrombotic events, even death, over the course of COVID-19. Early measurement of these cytokines, and timely co-administration of anti-inflammatories with anticoagulants could decrease thrombotic events and related fatal consequences."
