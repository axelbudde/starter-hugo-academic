	abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the influence of parental problem drinking on implicit and explicit alcohol expectancy of adolescents and young adults (12–24years). The study was conducted via the Internet, employing a between-subjects design. We measured alcohol expectancy by means of an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and a self-report questionnaire. A short version of the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST) was used to measure alcohol-related parental problem behavior. Our results showed that increased CAST-scores were correlated with a stronger implicit association between the concepts alcohol and arousal. In contrast, no such relationship was observed between parental problem drinking and self-reported expectancy of alcohol arousal. These findings provide tentative evidence that an implicit cognitive processing bias is implicated in the intergenerational transmission of addictive behaviors.},

Nevertheless public health policy planners lack easy access to well described interventions that are replicable and about which reasonable evidence of effectiveness in influencing drinking attitudes or behaviours are available.

The work is carried out through a cooperation by expert organisations from 32 European countries. RARHA’s Work Package 6 aims to present a Tool Kit of interventions that have demonstrated their effectiveness, transferability and relevance.In the communication with MS representatives and WP 6 partners we decided to collect the examples of good practices appertain to one of the three groups of interventions: Early interventions, Public awareness and School-based interventions. Using RARHA’s network and CNAPA we have searched for professionals experienced in alcohol related interventions, with a good overview and knowledge on interventions in their country, to provide reliable data at country level. In order to assess the collected examples we have developed the Assessment criteria based on an existing Dutch system for evaluating health-based interventions. The interventions were assessed based on the following criteria: a. Intervention is well described, b. Intervention is implemented in the real world/feasible/transferable, c. Intervention has a theoretical base and d. Intervention has been evaluated. There are four levels of evidence-based depending on the design of the studies that were looking into the effects of the intervention.},
